## Core Features:

- Credential Storage: Securely store credentials (passwords, usernames, URLs, and notes) with AES encryption.
- User Management: Enable multiple users/family members under a single account.
- Secure Sharing: Share selected credentials securely with specific family members.
- Credential Management: Filter and locate saved credentials by site URL or associated person.
- Password Analyzer: Password strength checker: a tool which assesses the complexity and security of newly created passwords.
- Role-Based Access: Enable access control; guarantee visibility only to credentials explicitly shared with the relevant user.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212) to create a modern dark mode interface.
- Primary color: Deep purple (#6a49bd), providing a sense of security.
- Accent color: Light purple (#b19cd9) to highlight important interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and shorter text segments.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for the body; the two sans-serifs pair well because 'Poppins' has some geometric flair that is absent in 'Inter'.
- Use minimalistic icons to represent different websites, users, and functions.
- Subtle transitions and animations when showing, editing, or sharing passwords.
